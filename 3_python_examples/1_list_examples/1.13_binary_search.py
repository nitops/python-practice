""" Write a Python program to implement a Binary Search """

"""Binary Search is a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. 
- Sort the array. - Begin with an interval covering the whole array. - If the value of the search key is less than 
the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. - Otherwise, narrow it to the upper 
half. - Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.
